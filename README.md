GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are a promising set of machine learning techniques that will greatly impact the future of many fields. In a nutshell, GANs employ the use of a generator and a discriminator. The generator competes with real data to trick the discriminator into being unable to differentiate the two inputs.
